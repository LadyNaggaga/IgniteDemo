To get you started, we created a set of samples (C# and F#).  These samples have been designed to provide a zero-install experience, allowing you to try the .NET kernel setup free.

## Steps

- Click on the **launch binder** badge below.

-  Select one of the .NET folder options, "csharp" or "fsharp" (C# or F#)
-  In the C# or F# folder you will find a *Docs* and a *Samples* folder.
    - Docs folder - A how to guide that goes over formatting, plotting, magic commands etc.

    - Select the *Samples Folder*, pick a .ipynb file that looks interesting, and start running the cells. You can just click Run to run the first cell. Each time you click Run it will run the next cell. 
    - Once the notebook has loaded make sure you trust it by clicking on the  **Not Trusted** button then **Trust**
