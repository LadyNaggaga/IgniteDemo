# Use our latest version on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)

###### Zero install - try our .NET Jupyter Notebook. 

**Requirement :**  A browser

To get you started, we created a set of samples (C# and F#).  These samples have been designed to provide a **zero-install** experience, allowing you to try the .NET kernel setup free.

## Steps

- Click on the **launch binder** badge below. 

   [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dotnet/try/master?urlpath=lab)


- This launches the binder service. If this is your first time visiting, it'll take a minute or two to cold start.

-  Select one of the .NET folder options, "csharp" or "fsharp" (C# or F#)
-  In the C# or F# folder you will find a *Docs* and a *Samples* folder.
    - Docs folder - A how to guide that goes over formatting, plotting, magic commands etc.

    - Samples folder - Contains a set of samples that you learn and experiment with.

    - Select the *Samples Folder*, pick a .ipynb file that looks interesting, and start running the cells. You can just click Run to run the first cell. Each time you click Run it will run the next cell. 
    - Once the notebook has loaded make sure you trust it by clicking on the  **Not Trusted** button then **Trust**

     *Please note the first cell might take a few seconds, since we are loading a few nuget packages*

     - Now, you can run and edit the cells, import and plot data.
