**Welcome to the Try .NET repo.**

Try .NET provides developers and content with tools to create interactive experiences.

There are different flavors of  Try .NET interactive experiences from the web with blazor(as seen on [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/hello-world)),  interactive documentation generator for .NET core with [dotnet try global tool](DotNetTry.md), and [.NET Jupyter Notebooks](Notebook.md). 

Our interactive experience powers the online interactive .NET documentation, [dotnet try global tool](DotNetTry.md) and [Notebooks](Notebook.md).

## Table of Content

- [Getting started with .NET Jupyter Notebooks](Notebook.md) : Write and run .NET code in Jupyter Notebooks
